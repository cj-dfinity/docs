This is a quick tutorial for deploying a "Hello World" dapp to the  Internet Computer (IC) in 10 minutes or less. Deployment of the dapp requires basic knowledge of using a terminal. Code editing knowledge is not necessary.

Before starting, take a look at a version of this dapp running on-chain: https://6lqbm-ryaaa-aaaai-qibsa-cai.ic0.app/

In this tutorial,  you will learn how to:

1. Install the Canister SDK

2. Build and deployed a dapp locally

3. Collect free cycles to power your dapp

4. Create a "cycles wallet" from which you can transfer cycles to any other dapps you want to power
5. Deploy a dapp on-chain

This simple `Hello` dapp is composed of two link:https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Glossary#C[canister smart contracts] (one for backend and one for frontend). The dapp's functionality works as such: it accepts a text argument as input and returns a greeting. For example, if you call the `greet` method with the text argument `Everyone` on the command-line via the canister SDK (see instructions below on how to install the canister SDK), the dapp will return `Hello, Everyone!` in your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx canister call hello greet Everyone
$ "Hello, Everyone"
----

* via the dapp in a browser, a pop-up window will appear with the message: `Hello, Everyone!`**

Note that the "Hello World" dapp consists of back-end code written in link:language-guide/motoko[Motoko], a programming language specifically designed for interacting with the (IC), and a simple webpack-based front-end. 

== Topics Covered in this Tutorial

* *Canisters* are the smart contracts installed on the IC. They contain the code to be ran and a state, which is produced as a result of running the code. As is the case of the "Hello World" dapp, it is common for dapps to be composed of multiple canisters.

* *link:developers-guide/concepts/tokens-cycles[Cycles]* refer to a unit of measurement for resource consumption, typically for processing, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. For the sake of this tutorial, cycles are analogous to Ethereum's gas: cycles are needed to run dapps, but unlike gas they are stable and less expensive. Every canister has a cycles account from which the resources consumed by the canister are charged. The Internet Computer's utility token (ICP) can be converted to cycles and transferred to a canister. ICP can always be converted to cycles using the current price of ICP measured in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights[SDR] (a basket of currencies) using the convention that one trillion cycles correspond to one SDR. **Get free cycles from the cycles faucet.**

* A *link:developers-guide/default-wallet[cycles wallet]* is a canister that holds cycles and powers up dapps.

== 1. link:1-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Install tools] 

 Required tools: Canister SDK and node.js. 

== 2. link:2-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Create default project] (1 min)

After the SDK is installed, create the default "Hello, World!" project with two canisters (backend and frontend).


== 3. link:3-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Deploy dapp locally] (3 min)

Test project by deploying it on your local machine. 

 

== 4. link:4-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Acquiring cycles] (5 min)

Add cycles to your account to deploy dapp on-chain.

== 5.link:5-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Deploy on-chain] (1 min)

Use cycles to deploy the "Hello, World!" dapp on-chain.

 

== Wrap-up
Congratulations! You have built a dapp fully on-chain (both backend and frontend) within 10 minutes. 

Tutorial takeaways:

* Dapps can be composed of multiple canisters
* Dapps can be deployed locally and on-chain
* Cycles are needed power dapps
* Get free cycles from the cycles wallet
* Free cycles can be used to power additional dapps

== Starting from scratch

If you wish to start from scratch, delete the SDK and associated profiles and re-install it. Follow the instructions here: link:../developers-guide/install-upgrade-remove{outfilesuffix}[Install, upgrade, or remove software].

**Be sure to save any identities linked to dapps or ICP.** 

== Ready for the next challenge?
